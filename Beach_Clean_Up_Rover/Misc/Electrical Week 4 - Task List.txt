Electrical Week 4 - Task List

Erick
* Should we implement github branches for proper version control? Allows everyone to manage their own branch, then merge to main as needed
* Create Battery charging system design
	* Battery connected should not need to be disconnected or swapped to another pin
	* Possible transistor design
* Is it okay if we supply the 5 motors from a 12V buck converter line?
* Decide between PMIC or multiple LDOS
* Figure out all voltages that we absolutely need for peripherals, 
	* other circuitry we can figure out later
* Send each member quick youtube video on how to choose their respective component

Miles
* Research 3 6V to 5V LDOs that will be sufficient for our current design (Use digikey/mouser for filter research)
* How many devices are going to use 5v?
	* What are each of their devices current requirements both nominally and peak

Sandeep
* Research 3 buck converter ICs that require >12V inout voltage and output 6V
* DOes the ouput current of the buck converter affect the output currents of its cascaded LDOS? 
	* IF 6v 1A output, then is the 6v -> 5v LDO constrained to 1A maximum??
* Need new battery, over 12V and over 3000maH

Ryan
* Buck converter Battery Voltage (>12V) to a 12V line
