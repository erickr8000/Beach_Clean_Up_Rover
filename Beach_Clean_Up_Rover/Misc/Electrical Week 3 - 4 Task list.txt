Electrical Week 3 - 4 Task list

@Electrical

Here's a quick review on what we should try to get done in the next week or so to the best of our abilitles.

Erick
* Create power systems design to start delegating research and component selection tasks to all members
* After some more reading on power design, Here are my current thoughts on the design:
	1. 12v -> 6v Switching Regulator for a power efficient voltage drop
	2. 6v -> 5v LDO for a low noise 5v rail to build smaller voltages from. Power loss is not a big issue here since step down is small
	3. 5v -> 3.3, 1.8 etc as needed using single Multi-channel PMIC DC/DC converter or Seperate LDOs
* Current requirements are important, how many amps or milliamps are expected to be drawn for each voltage rail?
	1. Take into consideration nominal and peak operation current draws for all peripherals (motors, sensors, etc)
	2. Once IC's for controller board are more solidified this might be something we need to turn back to.  

Once I have a system in mind and everyone is synced with the files I will start assigning everyone sub-circuits to start working on.

@Miles and @Ryan

Lets try and set up a 30 minute discord call in the evening this week so that I can get you set up with Altium, Github, and Inventhub
	1. Download Altium + Sign up for student license
	2. Download Github Desktop + Create account
	3. Create Inventhub account

@sandeep

Since I have you synced with altium files now just get familiar with the software at the moment. Feel free to add any random components
and get a feel for the process. Dont worry about accidentlaly deleting or messing something up, its all a learning process.
